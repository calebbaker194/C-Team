## Structure
Most of these examples will have the same file structure. First there will be a download containing multiple different folders. Each folder will have it's own PDF document With instructions. There will also be JAVA projects inside each of the parent folders for the end results of the example. The goal is to provide a step by step process that gives the reader the knowledge behind what is happening, while still completing interesting projects. 

### [Gradle](https://github.com/calebbaker194/C-Team/blob/main/Gradle/Gradle.md)
Gradle is one of the easiest ways for someone to add external dependencies to a Java project. It is used quite heavily in industry. There are other software that do the same thing and often people will ask you if you have experience with Buildship. That is the same Idea as Gradle. This will be used in almost all if not all of the following projects. It allows us to create code without reinventing the wheel.

### [SQL](https://github.com/calebbaker194/C-Team/blob/main/Database/Database.md)
This Tutorial will show you how to use SQL. It is important for any application to be able to interface with a database system. All business use a database system. This will teach you to use 2 types of databases. 
- Sql Lite- This is used for storage on the same computer. It is not as scalable as some of the other types of SQL
- PostgreSQL- This is an open source database software and is one of the fastest growing in the world.

### [Email](https://github.com/calebbaker194/C-Team/blob/main/Email/Email.md)
Sending email is really easy in java. This tutorial will teach you even outside of what you can do with only Java. 
- Send Email
- Check Email
- Set up Mail Server
- Anti Spoofing Filter.
### [Website](https://github.com/calebbaker194/C-Team/blob/main/WebServer/WebServers.md)
This section will teach you how to set up a web server. It will also show you how a simple trigger can be set up to send out automated emails from a server.

- Setting up a spark web server
- Adding thread for timed execution 
- Cookie verification for login
### Services
Java programs that are put on a desktop are sometimes used to monitor or run discreetly. Programs like Discord Or Google Drive run always in the background. making your java program into a service has multiple uses.
- Wrap java program as a system service in windows
- Monitor Temperature for computer and email every day the high and the low temperature. 
### Texting
This one is mostly will be code and examples. the testing or usage requires a Twilio account. A testing api key will be provided. And possibly a real API key. but this costs money based on use. 
- send text message
- receive text message
- convert email to text 
- convert text to email
